## About

<div align="justify">
I am a scientific researcher at MEO-IGE, Universit√© Grenoble Alpes. I have specialized in data assimilation and inverse methods for oceanographic applications. In particular, I am working on the BOOST-SWOT ANR project to update the DUACS optimal interpolation method in anticipation of the SWOT satellite data. More recently, I have acquired an expertise in the formulation of data challenges with, amongst others, the creation of the [ocean-data-challenges](https://github.com/ocean-data-challenges).
