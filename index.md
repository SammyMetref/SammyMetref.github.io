I have been working for several years in different mathematical and physical fields using data assimilation (cryptography, climatology, oceanography). 
These experiences have allowed me to aquire a fine expertise in data assimilation and geosciences. 
Today, my main field of research is improving oceanographic altimetric reconstruction from satellite observations using data assimilation.
